# souptf2overhaul
i replace sounds on the game team fortress 2

first download the first release (https://github.com/soupcantrolling/souptf2overhaul/releases/download/war/soupoverhaul.rar) and put the folder on tf/custom.
after that, you can download the new overhaul folder from the actual repo and drop it on custom so it overwrites the rar's stuff.
its important you download the rar first, im only separating the big folder from the rest on the repo so you dont have to download updates

**UPDATE**
it is now 1.7 fucking gb because i am bypassing valve's sv_pure bullshit
sory for the inconvenience kill valve
it might also be uncompatible with suond mods* tho it doesn't fuck with killsounds
